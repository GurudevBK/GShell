# GShell
A Rudimentary Bash-Like Shell Written in C

# Best of luck compiling
This program uses a C-library called [LIBFDR](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Libfdr/) written by [Dr. James Plank](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank)

First, build the library files in GShell/include/libfdr using the included makefile

Then, type `make` in the GShell directory
